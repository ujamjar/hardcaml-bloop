# Boolean algebraic operations and optimisations interface to HardCaml

BDDs (using buddy and the bdd package), SAT (using minisat) and various
simple representations of boolean networks (expressions, disjunctive/conjunctive
normal forms) and conversions between them.

I would like to add an Espresso (2-level) and multi-level optimisation
framework.
